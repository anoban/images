# _Bitmaps_
---------

Images used in this `README` for exhibition are stored as `JPEG` files in the `images` directory. But the algorithms in `<bmp.h>` cannot serialize bitmaps as `JPEG` files, bitmaps were converted to `JPEG`s using `Microsoft Photos` for use here, in order to minimize the repository size.
