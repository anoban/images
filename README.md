### _Warning:_

Owing to the use of non-opt-in SSSE3, AVX2 and AVX512 compiler (MSVC & LLVM) intrinsics, If compiles, will probably raise an illegal instruction hardware exception at runtime on unsupported CPU architectures. Unfortunately my expertise is very Windows centric hence,
I have no desire to accommodate the UNIX/g++ toolchain in this project.
